SQL clauses and its types


SQL clauses are like the conditional statements we use in other programming languages. They form specific parts of a SQL statement that perform a specific function and allow us to put constraints on data. 
The sql clauses can help filter out the data according to the users' needs. The main clauses are SELECT, FROM, WHERE, GROUP BY, HAVING, ORDER BY, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, and JOIN. Each clause has a syntax and its own set of rules and options.
They can also be used in combination to create complex queries.
