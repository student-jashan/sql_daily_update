1)We define query quality as:

The average of the ratio between query rating and its position.

We also define poor query percentage as:

The percentage of all queries with rating less than 3.

Write a solution to find each query_name, the quality and poor_query_percentage.

Both quality and poor_query_percentage should be rounded to 2 decimal places.


SELECT query_name,ROUND(AVG(rating/position),2) AS quality,ROUND(AVG(CASE WHEN rating < 3 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END * 100), 2)
AS poor_query_percentage 
FROM Queries 
WHERE query_name IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY query_name;


2)Write an SQL query to find for each month and country, the number of transactions and their total amount, the number of approved transactions and their total amount.

Return the result table in any order.

SELECT  SUBSTR(trans_date,1,7) as month, country, count(id) as trans_count, SUM(CASE WHEN state = 'approved' then 1 else 0 END) as approved_count, SUM(amount) as trans_total_amount, SUM(CASE WHEN state = 'approved' then amount else 0 END) as approved_total_amount
FROM Transactions
GROUP BY month, country
